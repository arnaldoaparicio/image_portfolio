        I'm no fancy pro photographer but I do enjoy taking pictures
        as much as the next person. Typically, people share their pictures
        on places like Facebook or Instagram but that's no fun. Why not build a dedicated little website
        for these things?<br>
        In all seriousness, this is meant as a playground for me to try new things to the site while showing
        off some pictures that have never been posted anywhere else.<br>
        Hope you enjoy the pictures 
        and stick around for more content!
